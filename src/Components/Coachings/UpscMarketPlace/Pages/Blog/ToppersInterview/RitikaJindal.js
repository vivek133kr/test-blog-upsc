              Ritika Jindal's journey from a small town to becoming the youngest
              IAS officer in the 2019 batch is truly inspiring. She was born and
              raised in Moga, Punjab, a town often known as the "NRI capital of
              Punjab." Despite the common belief in her town that boys would
              receive an education and opportunities to work abroad, while girls
              would be educated and married off, preferably to an NRI for the
              chance to go abroad, Ritika's father had a far-sighted
              perspective.
