              Arpit Gupta's journey to becoming an IAS officer began with a
              dream he had since the 9th grade. Despite studying Mechanical
              Engineering and briefly working as a Financial Market Analyst, his
              real passion was to join the civil services. What inspired him was
              the big difference between his life and that of a friend who
              didn't have the same opportunities due to their background.

              Arpit's determination came from realizing that while he had the
              advantage of studying in a convent school and his father's job at
              Indian Railways provided him with the basics to follow his dream,
              his friend from a local government school didn't have the same
              luck. This motivated him to want to fix the issues in the
              country's education system.

              Arpit Gupta believed that doing well in the UPSC exam wasn't just

              my motivation for pursuing this?" and "What positive outcomes do I
