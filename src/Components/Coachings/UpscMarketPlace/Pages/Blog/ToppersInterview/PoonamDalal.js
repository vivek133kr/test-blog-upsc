              Poonam Dalal Dahiya hails from the ancestral village of Chara in
              Jhajjar, Haryana. Born and raised in Delhi, her upbringing was
              ordinary, with her mother serving as a retired teacher and her
              father, a businessman who tragically passed away early in her
              life. She completed her school education from Nangloi, a small
              town near Delhi.

              Despite her limited exposure, Poonam possessed an inborn desire to
              make a mark in life. Her journey began with a teaching training
              program for primary schools, known as JBT (Junior Basic Training),
              which paved the way for her first government job. Unable to pursue
              a regular degree due to her employment commitments, she opted for
              an external graduation from Delhi University. At this point, she
              began to develop doubts about her ability to crack the UPSC exam,
              given the intense competition and dedication she observed in other
              aspirants in Delhi University.

              and secured a position at the State Bank of India, where she
              worked for three years. It was during this time that she achieved
