              To put it simply, if you see "Analyze," it means you need to
              understand the topic well, break it into parts and summarise it by
              co-relating these parts. But when it's "Critically Analyse,"
              you're expected to follow the steps that you use while analysing
              and then provide your fair judgement on the topic. For both types,
              it's important to organize your response, but "critical analysis"
              asks you to think much more deeply.
